## New series in April - July 2021: Fixing the publishing system series

From April onwards, we’re going to do ReproducibiliTea a little differently. For three to four sessions, we will focus on a particular aspect of the academic world, identify its problems and brainstorm solutions. The first topic we will tackle is the publishing system. Ever been bothered by the fact that publishing Open Access feels a lot like being the victim of grand larceny? Or that it can take years to get through the review process, only for your paper to be rejected (yet again)? Ever heard of the 450 Movement? In the first session of this new series, we will diagnose exactly what’s wrong with the current publishing system and identify its problems. In the second third session, we will discuss concrete solutions to those problems. In the final session, we will sum up the discussion and fine-tune our solutions.
In the last meeting, we will wrap up and discuss any further points left open. We will also collect more concrete examples of how these problems are already being addressed. After the series, we also plan to write a (short) report on the outcome of these three to four sessions, which we will make available on the OSCN website as a white paper and possibly also look to publish in a journal (if we still have confidence in the publishing system after we’re done!). Anyone who comes to one or more of the sessions will of course be acknowledged as a contributor to the report and paper.
