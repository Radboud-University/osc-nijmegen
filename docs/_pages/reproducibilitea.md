ReproducibiliTea is a global initiative bringing journal clubs on reproducibility and open science to, at the time of writing, about 20 countries spread over 4 continents. There is more information on the initiative and current chapter on the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/).

## Next event
Our next event will be on **September 15**, 2021, 15:00 CEST. For more information, see [here](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/reproTea15/). 
For all future meetings, see our [agenda](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/agenda/).


## New series in April - July 2021: Fixing the publishing system series

From April onwards, we’re going to do ReproducibiliTea a little differently. For three to four sessions, we will focus on a particular aspect of the academic world, identify its problems and brainstorm solutions. The first topic we will tackle is the publishing system. Ever been bothered by the fact that publishing Open Access feels a lot like being the victim of grand larceny? Or that it can take years to get through the review process, only for your paper to be rejected (yet again)? Ever heard of the 450 Movement? In the first session of this new series, we will diagnose exactly what’s wrong with the current publishing system and identify its problems. In the second third session, we will discuss concrete solutions to those problems. In the final session, we will sum up the discussion and fine-tune our solutions.
In the last meeting, we will wrap up and discuss any further points left open. We will also collect more concrete examples of how these problems are already being addressed. After the series, we also plan to write a (short) report on the outcome of these three to four sessions, which we will make available on the OSCN website as a white paper and possibly also look to publish in a journal (if we still have confidence in the publishing system after we’re done!). Anyone who comes to one or more of the sessions will of course be acknowledged as a contributor to the report and paper.

## Objectives
- learn about cool papers/initiatives related to open open science and reproducibility
- have friendly and engaging discussions about open science and reproducibility
- meet new people interested in these topics in the Radboud campus
- :tea: :tea: :tea:

## Paper suggestions
We want this journal club to reflect the interests of its members--you!
You can add your suggestions and contact information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1efHsgzEu9OqKNRk9EARDNL3gBfsPNRgbdt7-PhfWS-U/edit?usp=sharing).
Suggestions can be peer-reviewed papers, but also preprints, blog posts, iniatives etc.

When you suggest papers for discussion please keep these guidelines in mind:
- the topic of the paper should be relevant for open science (e.g.  pre-registration, replicability, reproducibility, robustness, open access, transparency, inclusivity, diversity, philosophy of science)
- length should not exceed 12 pages (for journal-formatted papers; 24 for double-spaced ones)
- not too technical please--discussion should be accessible to be people of different backgrounds!

## Practical info
The journal club will meet monthly (usually the 3rd Wednesday of the month; see exact dates below) at **15:00**. During the lockdown, meetings take place **online**. 

The person who suggested the topic of discussion will introduce it in 10 minutes or under and then we discuss! Meetings will last no longer than an hour.

In the presentation of the paper/topic of discussion identify:
- the *problem* the paper addresses
- the *solution* the paper advocates
- the *relevance* of the paper (for the presenter or more generally)
- what is *special* about the paper
- the *limitations* of the paper
