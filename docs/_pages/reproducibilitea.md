ReproducibiliTea is a global initiative bringing journal clubs on reproducibility and open science to, at the time of writing, about 20 countries spread over 4 continents. There is more information on the initiative and current chapter on the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/).

## Objectives
- learn about cool papers/initiatives related to open open science and reproducibility
- have friendly and engaging discussions about open science and reproducibility
- meet new people interested in these topics in the Radboud campus
