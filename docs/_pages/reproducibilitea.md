ReproducibiliTea is a global initiative bringing journal clubs on reproducibility and open science to, at the time of writing, 139 institutes in 27 countries spread over 5 continents. There is more information on the initiative and current chapter on the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/).

## Next event
Our next event will be on **December 15**, 2021, 15:00 CEST. For more information, see [here](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/reproTea19/). 
For all future meetings, see our [agenda](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/agenda/). For past meetings, see the schedule below.

Information on the special series we hosted from April to September 2021 can be found [here](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/publishing_system/).

## Objectives
- learn about cool papers/initiatives related to open open science and reproducibility
- have friendly and engaging discussions about open science and reproducibility
- meet new people interested in these topics in the Radboud campus
- :tea: :tea: :tea:

## Paper suggestions
We want this journal club to reflect the interests of its members--you!
You can add your suggestions and contact information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1efHsgzEu9OqKNRk9EARDNL3gBfsPNRgbdt7-PhfWS-U/edit?usp=sharing).
Suggestions can be peer-reviewed papers, but also preprints, blog posts, iniatives etc.

When you suggest papers for discussion please keep these guidelines in mind:
- the topic of the paper should be relevant for open science (e.g.  pre-registration, replicability, reproducibility, robustness, open access, transparency, inclusivity, diversity, philosophy of science)
- length should not exceed 12 pages (for journal-formatted papers; 24 for double-spaced ones)
- not too technical please--discussion should be accessible to be people of different backgrounds!

## Practical info
The journal club will meet monthly (usually the 3rd Wednesday of the month; see exact dates below) at **15:00**. For the time being, meetings will take place **online**. 

The person who suggested the topic of discussion will introduce it in 10 minutes or under and then we discuss! Meetings will last no longer than an hour.

In the presentation of the paper/topic of discussion identify:
- the *problem* the paper addresses
- the *solution* the paper advocates
- the *relevance* of the paper (for the presenter or more generally)
- what is *special* about the paper
- the *limitations* of the paper
