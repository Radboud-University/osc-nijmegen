**When**: 26 February 2020 from 16:00 to 18:00

**Where**: Room A229 at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (Wundtlaan 1, 6525 XD Nijmegen)

**What**: ReproducibiliTea partners up with repliCATS!
In February, ReproducibiliTea journal clubs are partnering up with repliCATS to evaluate the credibility of published research!
But what is repliCATS you may ask?
The aim of the [repliCATS](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) project is to elicit predictions about the replicability of scientific claims in the field of social science.
They have developed a two-step group elicitation method (the IDEA protocol) and a custom-built platform to make eliciting these predictions as easy as possible.
In this event, we'll be helping the repliCATS project along their goal of evaluating 3,000 claims!

**How does it work?**: First, we split in small groups of 4-5 people and agree on a claim to evaluate.
Then each person makes a private judgment about a claim.
Then the other group member's judgements (and their reasons) are revealed and we discuss!
After the discussion it's possible to privately update the final replicability estimate.

**IMPORTANT**
* You'll have to create a repliCATS account to participate in the event, which takes a little bit of time (15-20 minutes). You can sign up [here](https://score.eresearch.unimelb.edu.au/).
* There will be pizza.
