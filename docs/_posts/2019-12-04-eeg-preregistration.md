**When**: 4 December, 2019 at 15:00 - 16:00.

**Where**: Luria room (02.255) of the Trigon Building (Kapittelweg 29, 6525 EN Nijmegen)

**What:**

In June 2019, OSCN member Johannes and some colleagues ran a [hackathon at the SIPS meeting in Rotterdam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fckBKZEv_Jh0hJ6oVdYuK21krhZtnH0uhwcHp0j0TbE/edit) to develop pre-registration tools for neuroimaging. This meeting resulted in a [template for EEG studies investigating ERPs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmlHcWJcWMErZzjJgz9Q0rqsy-E9Vs9DYeKdvX9cawU/edit), which was further developed in a workshop at the MPI Leipzig in October. Now, the template is in a fairly advanced state, but needs critical feedback and users who try it out! Both experienced and new users of EEG are equally welcome to join our event on December 4. We will go through the template together, perform “beta-tests” based on our own past/future studies, and discuss improvements. Potentially, we might even take the template a bit further to also comprise time-frequency methods and/ or MEG or iEEG data!
