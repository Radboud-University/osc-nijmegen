Have you ever tried to find a lost file back? Or to make sense of an analysis script you wrote two years ago? Do you sometimes hate your past self? Have you ever handed in the wrong assignment? Join us for an event that will help you solve many of your future-self problems. We’ll share our best tips for naming things, file management and sharing files with others (including your future self). And don’t forget to bring your sniffer dog, as there will be an exercise on "Find the File". 

Johannes is a PhD student at the Donders Institute.
Hannah is a PhD student at the Behavioural Science Institute.
Eva is a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.
