**When**: 28 November, 2019 at 15:00 - 17:00.

**Where**: Instruction room of the Trigon Building (Kapittelweg 29, 6525 EN Nijmegen)

**What:** A hands-on workshop on using git and GitHub for collaborative work. Organized in collaboration with the [Dondrite](https://dondrite.ruhosting.nl/) study association for students of the Cognitive Neuroscience Masters.

In this workshop, we'll set you up with the minimal basics needed to start using git and GitHub for version control in your projects. In the first part, we'll do a git crash course and demos of the basic scenarios you'll use for the second part.

In the second part, we'll work together on a project hosted on a GitHub :octocat: repository. There, you'll start using the real magic of git :boom:, meaning you'll work on issues, pull changes from others to your repo, push your changes to the remote, make a PR, review your colleagues' contributsion, merge the changes ... (as a bonus, you'll get tons of new jargon to throw around). To prep you real good, we'll also show you how stuff can go wrong (been there, done that).

### How to best prepare for the workshop  
If possible, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) prior to coming to the workshop. That's the service we'll use for the hands-on part. It will save some time if you already have an account.

Note, you can [apply for the GitHub pro account](https://education.github.com/pack) as a student. (pro is not required for the workshop, free account will do just fine)

The workshop is self-contained and you _don't need to prepare for it_. But if you're eager, we list some useful resources below. Dig in!

### Useful resources :book:

- [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Git Pro book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (chapters 1, 2, and 6)
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) (chapters 4 and 5 on version control and GitHub)
